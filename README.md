## Development

### Before commit
1. Check if your code is correct with `grunt` (checks css and js syntax, builds sass file(s))
2. Beautify Code with `grunt beautify`
3. Run tests with `npm run test`. Please note that this could take a while since a full browser environment gets emulated.
4. Commit

Please note: you are asked to add tests to your added code. Check `test/coverage` for a code coverage report generated by istanbul. This is in no means a qualitative measure but a good indicator if you should add more tests.
